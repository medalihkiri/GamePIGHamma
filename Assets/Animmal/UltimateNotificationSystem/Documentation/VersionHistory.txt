Version 1.24
- UNS provides a way to manage notifications you show using NotificationStatus callback. But one common use for it would be to call a notification using a specific Unique ID, and then Hide that specific instance of notification using that Unique ID.

Use ShowNotificationWithID, GetNotificationWithID, and HideNotificationWithID functions on Notification Manager to make use of this new feature.
